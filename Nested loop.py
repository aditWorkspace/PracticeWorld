for i in range(0,5):
    for a in range(0,9):
        print(a)

b = 5
for i in range(7):
    print(b*i)
#Run this code. For the first time i=0, second time i = 1, third time i = 2 and so on. The next line says multiply..
#i and b. B = 5 as you can see so it is going to print the first 7 numbers of 5:    0, 5, 10, 15, 20 ,25 ,30. COOL
