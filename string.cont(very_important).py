a = 'fgslkfgslk'

print(a[-1])
#python printed the last digit because it can go backwards. Because f is 0, -1 is going to be the one before it
#There is going to be nothing before it, so it is going to go the end.

print(a[:-1])

print(a[::3])
# this is going to print everything in sets of 3.

print(a[::-1])
#this is going to print everything backward.

a = a + "fsjsfsfdgfsd"
print(a)
print(a*10)
#this will print everything 10 times.

#VERY IMPORTANT
print(a.lower())
#this will print everthing lower case!
print(a.upper())
#this will print everything uppercase!
print(a)
#though remember that the string will still be the same after whatever you do to it.

print(a.split('s'))
#this will split the string removing all the s characters and then python stops the string there. JUST CLICK PRINT!!!!!
